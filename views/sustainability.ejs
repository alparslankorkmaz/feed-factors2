              Feed Factors has eliminated plastic in containerised
              transportation. We have substituted plastic for tri-ply cardboard
              which is recyclable and biodegradable, removing 120 tonnes of
              plastic to landfill annually.
            </p>

            <h3 class="my-5 pt-5 mt-md-0 pt-md-0">GOALS AND PROGRAMS</h3>
            <p>
              We are currently testing renewable programs to further reduce our
              dunnage to landfill. We are focusing our attention on Recyclable
              tote bags and substituting the Silica sacks we currently use in
              each container, with biodegradable clay bags.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our considerate approach to sustainability has helped us achieve
              the GAFTA’s Sustainability Pledge and a Queens award for
              Sustainable Development.
